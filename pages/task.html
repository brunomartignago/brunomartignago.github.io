      <h2>01. Introduction</h2>

      <p class="case-subtitle">
        In this project, I was challenged to create an app to solve a fictitious problem related to the management of day-to-day chores between parents and children. At the beginning of the piece, I provide an in-depth description of the proposition, but I would like to highlight that this was an amazing project in which I fully leveraged AI capabilities to accelerate my processes. For example, the research process that could have taken quite a while to figure out was greatly simplified through deep discussions with the GPT model, which generated different scenarios for me to consider and illustrate possible outcomes and solutions.

      <h2>02. The challenge</h2>

      <h3>Summary</h3>

      <p>
        You were just hired by Company X to design a mobile product experience that makes it easy for  parents and their children to track household chores. Design the experience from the perspective of the parent and the children. 
      </p>

      <h3>Pain Points</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Parents</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Regularly complain that household chores aren’t completed on time</li>
          <li>Don’t know which chores have been started, and which haven’t</li>
          <li>Get frustrated when their children forget regularly-repeating chores</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Children</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Don’t know when their parent expects the chore to be completed by</li>
          <li>Often finish a chore, only to be told by their parents that another chore was more important</li>
          <li>Don’t have an easy way to tell their parents they’ve started or finished a chore</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h3>Task</h3>

      <p>
        We’re looking for you to recommend flows that address the pain points for parents and children.  We expect to see a user flow or information architecture that represents the UX, some lo-fidelity designs/sketches, and some hi-fidelity designs with a consistent visual identity.

        The Guardian’s app includes many tools for creating and managing tasks. It's easy to follow the progress for separated kids and create and manage different types of reward systems for each kid in the household.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Guardian app also has a complete dashboard on the home page, allowing a quick check-in on progress daily.
