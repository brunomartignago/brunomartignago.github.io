      <h2>01. Introduction</h2>

      <p class="case-subtitle">
        This is, to this day, the most complicated and rewarding project of my career. We worked as a team of two designers and one lead strategist, and our objective was to explore and push the limits of what Artificial Intelligence could do when used to its full potential. The piece you'll read here is one of the many usecases we worked through in 2023. This is a project that would have been impossible to work on alone; the partnership between Kaeli Simmons and Matt Walton was crucial to the delivery of this amazing work.

        When we think about the way online experiences evolved so far and what we can expect with the insurgence of Artificial Intelligence, there is a visible line dividing how people search for information. We can break these into three key moments:

      <p>
        The pace of technological advancements is rapidly increasing, offering incredibly innovative solutions that can achieve tasks that once required a large team - take for example LLMs, video generation, personalized recommendation, no-code application, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Goldman Sachs says that over the next 10 years, AI could increase productivity by 1.5 percent per year. And that could increase S&P500 profits by 30 percent or more over the next decade.
      </p>

      <p>
        To build the future of connection, we need to redefine how browser navigation works, bringing other systems closer to it.

        What is an amorphous profile?

        At the center of the system are the pattern profiles. Patterns are derived from baselines in the system, which are used to compare and match against new data. Based on the match percentage, the system determines which course of action to take.
      </p>

      <p>
        These patterns can reside at various levels within the organization, including corporate, user, and workflow levels. In user patterns, patterns are continually informed by historical behavior, data from other patterns with attributes (people like me), or even, sometimes, a base set of rules. (roles & permissions), and real-time interaction with the system (e.g., location, time). 
      </p>

      <p>
        We refer to the pattern as the amorphous profile because it continually evolves.

        I won’t go into the details of how these attributes work in this piece (but you can reach out to me if you want to know more). These attributes are important because they create the base of what we call the Digital Twin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The essence of a participant’s traits, behaviors, and patterns is distilled into an AI-driven virtual twin that participates in a continuous AI-driven simulation experience. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The profile and attributes of a real-world participant are mapped to key attributes within the virtual persona during user configuration.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may wonder, how will this transform our customer experience?
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer lies in building a personal IT assistant powered by connected AI, delivered through continuous interaction & engagement.

      <h2>03. Digital twin - The AI integration</h2>

      <p>
        Here are the core elements that made this integration possible:
      </p>

      <p>
        <bold>Connected Engagement</bold> - Merging the power of generative content, digital twin, digital human, hyper-personalization, and workflow automation into a single connected experience.
      </p>

      <div class="case-hero-wrapper">

        <img

          class="case-hero-image reveal"
          loading="lazy"
        />

      </div>

      <p>
        <bold>Personalized Digital Advisor</bold> - The system's interaction can mold the user's personality, and the system's background should progress to improve the overall experience. The Avatar's functionality acknowledges and recalls the user’s preferences across all devices to ensure effortless transitions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every user interaction within the system informs the profile, determining and surfacing user-specific functionality. To start, a broad set of functionality surfaced as the user began using the system (such as rules). As the user interacts with the system, the functionality becomes more focused on the features with the most interaction. Also, the system will utilize informational and clarification responses. The interface must align with the user’s behavior to provide the user with further insights. This also removes the need for complex navigation structures.

        <bold>Simplified UX</bold> - Three Panel Design

      </div>

      <p>
        <bold>Virtual Explainer</bold> - The digital advisor operates similarly to a tour guide, focusing on key information and allowing users to ask targeted questions about the highlighted content. Its purpose is to quickly filter and provide essential contextual information to aid in decision-making.

      <p>
        For sales agents, the AI assistant even gives additional help. If a user requests further assistance or a subject is better handled by a human, the AI can identify which sales agent is responsible for that user and trigger a notification so the human agent can get in touch with the user when help is needed.

      <h2>04. Feature Highlight</h2>

      <p>
        Here's a list of features that we think make this experience amazing:
      </p>

      <p>
        <bold>Customized recommendation</bold> - The system will gather information about you, your company, and your navigation, and provide you with informed recommendations.
      </p>

      <div class="case-hero-wrapper">

        <img

          class="case-hero-image reveal"
          loading="lazy"
        />

      </div>

      <p>
        As you navigate and request specific products or services, the assistant will cross-reference the information it has about you and find the best match between your profile and what you’re looking for.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to convey that information in a good way to the user, metrics will be displayed - and noticed that those metrics will be chosen depending of the context of the request, so for example, if the user is requesting for a laptop to run SolidWorks (which requires a lot of GPU power), it will give you metrics about rendering and stability.
      </p>

        <li>AI agent panel - The AI assistant is always handy and can be found in the right panel</li>

      <ol>
        <li>Request processing - Whenever the AI assistant identifies a request being made by any user, it processes the known information and generates a recommendation for the sales agent to use in the collaborative workspace</li>
        <li>Product recommendation - Once the recommendation is ready, it will pop up on the log, and the sales agent can use it or see it on another screen to validate if the recommendation is good enough</li>
        <li>Action line summary - As recommendations and actions are done, they get stored in the action line summary, so whenever the sales agent want/need to use them, they can just click on the right icon and use on the collaborative workspace - this whole process removes a lot of friction of the quoting and purchasing processes, since the AI agent will do most of the time consuming work, while users and sales agents can discuss the configuration of the products</li>
